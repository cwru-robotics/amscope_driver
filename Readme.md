Driver to publish Amscope camera images.

At the moment, only one single camera is supported per machine. It will always publish on `/amscope/image_raw`.

### First Time Installation

Copy the file `lib/libnncam.so` into `/usr/lib`. This will require administrator permissions (for instance `sudo nautilus`). Then, restart the computer.
